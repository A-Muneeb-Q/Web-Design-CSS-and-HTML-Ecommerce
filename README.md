# Project Name: E-commerce Website

## Overview
Welcome to our E-commerce website project! Click on the link above to explore the deployed website. This project is designed to showcase various products across different categories. We have implemented a fake store API for data retrieval, and the website consists of four main pages: Home/Index, About, Contact, and Products.

### Pages:
1. **Home/Index:**
   - Features a slider and a selection of products.

2. **About:**
   - Provides information about the website, its mission, and background.

3. **Contact:**
   - Allows users to get in touch with us.

4. **Products:**
   - Displays all available products, categorized into sections such as Men's Clothing, Women's Clothing, Jewelry, and Electronics.

## Performance and SEO
To ensure optimal performance and search engine optimization, we have implemented the following practices:

- **Lazy Loading:**
  - All images are loaded using lazy loading mechanisms to improve page load times.

- **Semantic HTML:**
  - We have used semantic HTML to create a well-structured document, enhancing accessibility and SEO.
